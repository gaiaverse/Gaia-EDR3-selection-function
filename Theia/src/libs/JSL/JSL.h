The JSL (Jack Standard Library) is a collection of code written by Jack Fraser (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6980-8484) during the course of his PhD (2018-2022)

This code is intended to capture several elements of boilerplate code that I ended up writing again and again across several projects. 
It shouldn't be of any interest to anyone else, but just in case, it is distributed under a GNU v3 public license. Go nuts, weirdos.
