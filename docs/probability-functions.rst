Probability Functions
##############################

In the course of evaluating the probability that the properties of a given Star would arise given a proposed EfficiencyVector, we must make use of several mathematically in-depth calculations to determine both :math:`p(K = k| \vec{x})` and :math:`\nabla_x p(K = k | \vec{x})`. The following functions are implementations of this statistical modelling.
