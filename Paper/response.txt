Reviewer:
The manuscript "Completeness of the Gaia-verse III: using hidden states to infer gaps, detection efficiencies and the scanning law from the DR2 light curves" by Boubert et al. is the third of a series of papers focused on the study of the completeness of the Gaia DR2 catalogue. In this manuscript the authors derive a new scanning law for the spacecraft and use it to detect gaps in the detection of sources and to establish the magnitude-dependence of the detection probability as a function of time. The methodology, very complex at some steps, is well explained. I appreciate the pedagogical examples to help the readers unfamiliar with the involved maths, in the same line of papers I and II. The results are very relevant and can help to improve the use and analyse of the Gaia data and the scientific results derived. They justify the publication of the manuscript in MNRAS, with a minor revision listed below.
Authors:
We thank the reviewer for their careful review. We agree with all of the points they made and have made revisions to the manuscript accordingly. When responding to their point about aberration, we realised that we had underestimated the scale of the effect in the across-scan direction. We decided to revise the entire paper with the effect of aberration accounted for, which caused the excess noise parameter to slightly decrease (Fig. 1) and the 63 day period in the across-scan offsets to disappear (Fig. 2), because the MEKF had previously been fitting the aberration of the sources.

Reviewer:
Pg. 3, Eq(7). The meaning of G_i is not explained.
Authors:
This equation lost its context when it was moved from Sec. 4. We have changed the notation to bring it in line with Sec. 2 and added a brief explanation.

Reviewer:
Pg. 3, Sec. 2.2. The analogy of the author's long walks dependency on the weather could be improved. In this case, we have direct access to the states X_i (raining or not raining), which is not the case for a Hidden Markov Model. Note that this comment has a very low priority. 
Authors:
We agree that the original analogy was flawed, because we hadn't phrased it so that the weather information was hidden. We have replaced the analogy with another that is more clear.

Reviewer:
Pg.4, Eq. (17). Is S_i just a definition or has some special meaning? In the first case, consider using the triple bar symbol \equiv.
Authors:
We have added an interpretation of S_i, y_i and K_i immediately following those equations, and have used \equiv when defining those three terms.

Reviewer:
Pg. 4, before eq. (23): p_i and s_i are the position and velocities, respectively. It should be explained.
Authors:
Our previous notation was dreadful given that p and s are both usually used to denote positions or distances. We have switched to using q to denote velocity, added definitions to the text, and adding in the new Eqs. 24 and 25 to make clear where the following equation comes from.

Reviewer:
Pg.4, Introduction section 3: the colour variation affects the shape of the PSF of the Gaia instrument, which is colour-dependent. So, for an accurate determination of the position of a star on the focal plane, we need to know its colour. A short explanation of this effect could help to understand the non-ideality of variable stars for an extreme attitude precision determination.
Authors:
We have added a comment to the introduction of Sec. 3.

Reviewer:
* Pg 4. Sec 3.1: Sec 3.3 of Lindegren et al. 2012 (already cited in the manuscript) discuss the application of the quaternions to the Gaia Scanning Law. A reference to this paper could be useful.
Authors:
We have added an additional comment to the end of the introduction to Sec. 3 to make clear that AGIS uses quaternions too.

Reviewer:
Pg 5., Sec 3.2: end of first paragraph: A couple of numbers about the effect of the aberration can help to justify its not inclusion in the analysis. In particular, its effect on the detection time (which I roughly estimate in a few tenths of second).
Authors:
We have added numbers to justify us excluding gating effects, but realised that aberration was an important effect in the across-scan direction. We have now accounted for aberration throughout the paper.

Reviewer:
Pg 8. Last paragraph section 3: Is there some explanation for the observed periodic differences between both scanning laws?
Authors:
We believe this is due to small offsets in the angular velocity of the nominal scanning law and our derived scanning law. We have added text to the last paragraph of Sec. 3 stating that, and have added an analogy in footnote 3 to try and make it clear to the reader. We note that the 63 day periodic offsets were due to us ignoring aberration and have now disappeared.

Reviewer:
Pg 13. Last paragraph Sec 4.4: Figure 5 is one of the most important results of the paper. I miss a discussion of this figure. For instance, probability drops around days 2825, 3450 and 3600 are due to the Galactic Plane scan (crowding). On the other hand, the low detection probability for faint stars at the beginning is likely related to the contamination of the mirrors.
Authors:
We have added a discussion of this Figure. Interestingly, the low detection probability at the beginning is likely due to the faint-detection threshold being set to G=20 for the first part of the mission.

Reviewer:
The attitude of the spacecraft as a function of time is a DPAC product. I don't know if it is available (maybe under request or maybe it will be published in the future). It will be very interesting to compare this actual attitude with your determination.
Authors:
We have attempted to obtain the official attitude in the past. We last asked in 2019 and were only successful in extracting the nominal scanning law from DPAC, and even that took six months to be approved. The only reason that the nominal scanning law is publicly available now is our request from 2019. We agree that it would be fantastic for the official attitude to be available and for this paper to not have been necessary. Only the nominal scanning law covering the period of EDR3 will be released with EDR3 (see https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/earlydr3), suggesting that we will not have an official attitude determination until DR4 at the earliest. We have added some of this text to the conclusion.

Reviewer:
Pg. 6, last paragraph: a comma (",") is missing after "MEKF"
Authors:
We have added that comma.
